Based on these factors, we can design the datastore using a relational database with the following schema:
ServiceMonitoringData:
  - api_name (string): name of the API.
  - user_id (integer): ID of the user making the request.
  - request_time (datetime): timestamp of the request.
  - response_time (integer): response time of the request in milliseconds.
  - error_status (boolean): whether the request resulted in an error.



This schema enables us to store the service monitoring data in a structured manner and use SQL queries to perform the required operations, such as locating the API with the highest average response time across users, the highest average response time for each user, and the error percentage of each API in 1 hour buckets for 24 hours. 

For example, the following SQL query can be used to get the API with maximum average response time across users:

SELECT api_name, AVG(response_time) AS avg_response_time
FROM ServiceMonitoringData
GROUP BY api_name
ORDER BY avg_response_time DESC
limit 1

This query calculates the average response time for each API, and then returns the API with the maximum average response time.
Similarly, the following SQL query can be used to get the API with maximum average response time for each user:

SELECT user_id, api_name, AVG(response_time) AS avg_response_time
FROM ServiceMonitoringData
GROUP BY user_id, api_name
ORDER BY avg_response_time DESC


This query calculates the average response time for each API and user, and then returns the API with the maximum average response time for each user.
Finally, the following SQL query can be used to get the error percentage of each API in buckets of 1 hour for 24 hours:

SELECT api_name, request_time, SUM(error_status) / COUNT(*) AS error_percentage
FROM ServiceMonitoringData
GROUP BY api_name, request_time

This query calculates the error percentage of each API in each hour by dividing the number of errors by the total number of requests.
